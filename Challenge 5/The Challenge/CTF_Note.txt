The files are already encrypted and ready for the ctf.

You can not execute the cryptor directly by running the exe..
It is compiled with linux gcc and can run on terminal with ./minecraft.exe and should be placed in the main directory where all the folders are..
Same goes for the decryptor.. (should be placed in the main challenge5 folder)..

If there is any problem running it please compile by - 

gcc CryptoRami.c -o Minecraft.exe
------------------------------------------------
Note that any file in "importantFiles" directory will be encrypted..
Any changes to the file names after encryption will result in problems while trying to decrypt..

- Tested on wsl ubuntu (windows subsystem linux)
